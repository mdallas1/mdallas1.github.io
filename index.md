# About me

I am an early-career mathematician working in numerical analysis and 
specializing in nonlinear solvers and their applications. I earned 
my PhD from the University of Florida in May 2024 under the suprvision of 
[Dr. Sara Pollock](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/spollock/). The topic of my 
dissertation was the analysis of [Anderson acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_acceleration) applied to singular problems and its applications to 
parameter-dependent nonlinear PDEs. Since Fall 2024, I have been a postdoctoral teaching fellow in mathematics at the [University of Dallas](https://udallas.edu/) in Irving, Texas.
