I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Math and Physics in May 2019 from [Georgia College and State University](https://www.gcsu.edu/) in Milledgeville, Georgia.  My senior capstone project concerned fractional calculus and its relation to the famous tautochrone problem. The PDF can be found [here](https://libjournals.unca.edu/ncur/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dallas-Matthew-FINAL-LaTex.pdf). I then traveled to Gainesville, Florida in pursuit of a PhD in mathematics at the University of Florida. 

I earned my PhD in May 2024 under the advisement of [Dr. Sara Pollock](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/spollock/). My [dissertation](https://ufdc.ufl.edu/UFE0060881/00001) focused on the analysis of Anderson acceleration and it's application to nonlinear PDEs.
